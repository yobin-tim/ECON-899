# Notes:
I(Mitch) create and rendered in pdf some notebooks that we can use both to do testing and to turn in the results along with the 
code. I think this is a good alternative that removes the extra step of creating a latex doc.

## Examples:
- [Example of a Notebook](test_nb.ipynb) and [rendered version] (test_nb.pdf).
- [Example of a Problem Set solution](PS2/Notebooks/PS2_solution.ipynb) and [pdf version](PS2/Notebooks/PS2_solution.pdf).
